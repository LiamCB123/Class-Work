Assignment Overview:
The purpose of this assignment is to review material that was taught in previous classes. In this assignment, I did many things which include opening a file, writing in a file, utilizing arraylist, and making an object class. For my object class, I had to make different methods which had different functions, such as being a constructor, being able to create an object ( in this case the object being a clock), overriding different methods (which include the toString and compareTo methods), and being able to write methods for getters and setters. For my clockshop class, I had to build a class that helps store the clock objects into arraylists. I also had to write methods that would sort the clocks in the arraylist from smallest to the most time on the clocks, finding a object in an arraylist through a given index, reading through a file and placing the objects into an arraylist, opening and writing in that file, finding the index of the clock in the arraylist, and building an arraylist. I guess another thing that I think this project is supposed to help refresh is how to write a Java Doc comments. I say this because we did have to use Java Doc comments in the project, which important, but also because I assume Tom expects us to know this and being able to review Java Docs should help out throughout the quarter.Overall, this project is supposed to help give a refresher of what was taught before, and having these refreshers should help out with the material that will be given out later throughout the quarter.


Technical Impression:
For this assignment, it was a big refresher for me. I haven’t programmed with Java over the summer so I forgot a lot of the material of the summer. I was mostly looking up how to do certain things, like how to sort through an arraylist. I did see sample codes in my sources, and I just utilized in my code. For example, for the delimiter, I didn’t know how to utilize that so I looked up a YouTube video with example code, and I utilize that and made it to where the code was working for me. I also asked for clarification from another classmate to help me better understand the assignment. From there, my classmate was like a tutor and we talked it out until I figured out what I should do and put that into my code. For the most part, I wasn’t too frustrated on certain methods, but there were 3 methods I found particularly difficult. These methods were advanceHour, sortClocks, and fillClockShop. I was having a very difficult time with these methods, but I overcame those challenges by finding websites on StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks that helped me see how I could solve this problem. One other thing, I found it a little difficult to do the Java Docs. It has been a while since I did that, that was why but I got the hang of it after looking through my old coding assignments and how I Java Docs those assignments. Other than that, I found everything else to be a little easier.


Unresolved problems in my submission:
From what I noticed with my code, everything seemed to work perfectly fine,
so there should not be any problems that I am aware of.

Anthoney Petrov helped me with my advanceHour class, he helped me understand the problem
and helped me find an error in my code. To expand on that, I had a problem with it and I couldn't
find it so I asked him to help me find what the problem was, he helped, and from there I wrote the code,
that solved the problem, he did not share or give me the answer, I want to emphasize that.


Extra Credit:
I am not 100% sure if I did the extra credit, but I changed the delimiter to take in a : and a new line
I am not sure if the way I did it was the write way, but when I run the test it works. I am not sure what else to put
but I also made sure to do a while loop while using nextInt for the scanner to add the clocks.
Basically my while loop is going through the file and adding it to the hour, minute and second,
and then making it into the clock. Other then that I am not sure if I did the extra credit correct.

Questions:
I do have one question, when I was reading over how you want the java docs to be done, you mention
to comment the source file, I was confused by that and didn't know what to do from there, so what do I do
because I didn't know what a source file is what to comment on?
