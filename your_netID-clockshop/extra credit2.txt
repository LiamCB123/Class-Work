"You will freeze me to within 0.1 degree of absolute 0."
The logic is as follows:
The leader said:
"If your statement is true, we will use your molecules to feed our fusion reactor. If your statement is false, we will freeze you to within 0.1 degree of absolute 0."
If Mr. Spock's statement is true, then according to the rules the Logiconians would have to use his molecules to feed their fusion reactor.
However, Mr. Spock made the statement: "You will freeze me to within 0.1 degree of absolute 0."
For this statement to be true, the Logiconians would have to freeze Mr. Spock as he stated.
But if they did freeze him, then his statement would be false (because he stated they would freeze him and they did).
So for Mr. Spock's statement to be true, it must actually be false. This creates a logical paradox for the Logiconians.
