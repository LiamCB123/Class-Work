It would take a minimum of 2 weightings to solve this problem. For the first weighting, weight coins 1,2,3 on the left side and weigh 4,5,6 on the other side. If they are balance then 7 or 8 is the light one. if the left side (1-3) is lighter, then 1,2, or 3 is lighter, and if it is the right side that is lighter (4-6) then one of those coins is lighter. In the second weighing, if 7 or 8 is the 2 possible coins, just weigh it to see which one is lighter. If it is coins (1-3) then weigh 1 and 2 and see if they are lighter and if not then it is 3. This would be done the same for the right side.
